          Happy bday to my JUMBOO, since after soo many years finally hum baat kr rhe
          is time hehe, I've been lucky to have you in my life, you made me feel better when anything 
          happens.We fight, we laugh, we cry, we dont talk for months but when we get back it feels soo
          "apna apna". Talking to you makes me feel better. I cant even think of loosing you from my lfe.
          I just wanna make sure you stay happy and keep smiling. May all your wishes come true and I'll always be there
          to irritate you. And you cant imagine kitna happy hu mai milne ke liye kl and also teko "dekhne" ke liye hehe.
          Happy bday once again MY LOVE.
          <br />
